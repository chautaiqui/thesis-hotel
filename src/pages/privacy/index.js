                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
                the following applies:
                <ol type="i">
                  <li>
                    Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                    purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be
                    allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                    such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on
                    consent or any other of the following legal bases. This,
                    however, does not apply, whenever the processing ofPersonal
                    Data is subject to European data protection law;
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                    public interest or in the exercise of official authority
                    vested in the Owner;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                    interests pursued by theOwner or by a third party.

                whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
